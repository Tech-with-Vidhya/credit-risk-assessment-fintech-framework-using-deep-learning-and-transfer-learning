# CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT: A FINTECH FRAMEWORK
This project represents the credit risk assessment dual framework of predicting credit scores and the forecasts of credit default risk of the consumers of the financial institutions like commercial banks and lending firms. 

The implementation is dealt that mimics the real-world FICO Scoring Model with the custom enhancements to include lender's internal credit risk factors by proposing a new Domain-Tech Feature Selection Approach along with Deep Learning and Transfer Learning techniques. 

This is the masters final project delivered as part of my course of studying Masters in Big Data Science program at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), United Kingdom.

**Dataset:**
The Lending Club Dataset referred for this project is collected from the official Kaggle Website as below:

**Project Life-Cycle:**
A data science problem solving life-cycle is implemented as illustrated below; with proposed contributions interms of the new domain-tech feature selection approach and transfer learning based architecture for credit risk modelling.
